This is a cheese website that I built during my Server-side scripting ASP.net Classes in the fall semester of 2024. The website is called cheese and thank you, it is a fully functioning website that allows users to view and purchase different types of cheeses. Users with admin privlages can add, edit, or delete cheeses from the database. This website is built in c# with full MVC programming.
